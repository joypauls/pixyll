## Before We Dive In

**Euler's Number**, the number $$e$$, appears everywhere in mathematics and I mean that almost literally. If you're anything like me, you learned even before university courses to just accept $e$ as another one of those weird special numbers in the same plane of existence as $$\pi$$. Like $$\pi$$, $$e$$ is a **transcendental number**, meaning that it is not algebraic and cannot be expressed as a fraction, among other things. Now that isn't really what makes it special though - the set of transcendental numbers numbers is uncountable whereas the set of algebraic numbers is countable. What makes it special is just how often it pops up in seemingly disconnected applications.

$$e \approx 2.71828...$$

To begin to understand what makes it special, humor me and try to forget everything you know about Euler's number.

## Exponential Growth and Decay from Scratch

Let's start by considering a family of functions with parameter $$a$$ that grow exponentially with respect to a variable $$t$$,

$$f(t) = a^t$$

where $$a,t \in \mathbb{R}^+$$ just to make it easy on us. Let's look at plot showing $$f$$ for a few different values of $$a$$ to build some inuition:

We can group the dynamics of this family into 3 categories:

- When $$0<a<1$$, we have *exponential decay*
- When $$a=1$$, $$f$$ is constant
- When $$a>1$$, we have *exponential growth*

If we inspect the plot closer, it looks pretty clear that while our inital value $$f(0)$$ is always $$1$$, the difference in inital conditions is the derivative at 0, $$f^{\prime}(0)$$, the inital growth trajectory. How does this impact the dynamics of $$f$$?

$$f^{\prime}(t) = \frac{d}{dt} a^t$$
$$ = \frac{d}{dt} a^t$$

$$\begin{align} S  &= 1+2+3+\cdots \\ 2S &= 2 + 4+ 6 + \cdots \\ \end{align}$$
